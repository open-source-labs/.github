# GOVERNANCE (Under Construction ðŸ”¨)
_This document outlines the governance model for the Open Source Labs organization. This includes detailed descriptions of different roles, nomination processes, code review processes, and Code of Conduct enforcement._

<!-- // TODO: Things to add here -->

- [ ] Different types of official roles / contributor levels in the organization (contributor, core contributor, maintainer, etc.)
- [ ] What OSLabs Beta is and OSLabs Main
- [ ] Process to be promoted from OSLabs Beta to OSLabs Main To be promoted to OSLabs Main there may be additional work needed to put the product into a state to be easily contributed to (i.e. transitioning credentials/infrastructure, ensuring that Splash Pages are properly set up, etc.)
- [ ] Board of Directors 

## Get Involved

**Anything that supports the Open Source Labs community is a valuable contribution!**

All types of contribution are meaningful. This can include code changes, typo fixes, and even posting about Open Source Labs products to your personal blog or social media. No contribution is too small!

Anyone can become an Open Source Labs contributor (yes, even you!). Engineering ability is not required. Our goal is to recognize all contributors to the project regardless of skill, experience or background.
