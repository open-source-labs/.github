# How to Contribute to Open Source Labs Products

## Welcome 👍🎉
Hello and welcome to all! We, the Open Source Labs team, are very excited that you are here. Open Source Labs and the products we develop are only possible due to the incredible and brilliant engineers that contribute to them. As an organization, we aim to be an open and safe place where engineers and designers from any stage of their career can grow themselves and the open source community through cutting edge technology.

Here are some important resources to be aware of:
- [Open Source products that we maintain/host]()
- [Code of Conduct]()
- [Security Vulnerabilities]()
- ...
<!-- // TODO: add more and links -->


## Getting Started 
- If you are interested in contributing to a specific product that we host, but you're not sure where to get started be sure to checkout the "Open Issues" section for that product. If you are not extremely experienced with open source contributions, make sure to be on the lookout for bug reports / issues that are tagged with the "good for first contributions" flags.
<!-- // TODO: Check the icon above -->


## Did you find a bug? 🐛
- Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in one of our products, and instead to refer to our [security policy](). 
<!-- // TODO:Add security policy link -->

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues for that product. If bug has already been reported, please feel free to add to the discussion.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. If possible use the appropriate reporting template from the list below. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is or is not occurring.
<!-- // TODO: insure this makes sense based off our bug reporting template  -->

  - [Generic template for issues]()
  <!-- // TODO: add links -->

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?🧑‍💻🐛🙅
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch ensuring that the PR template is fully filled out.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- A member from the core Open Source Labs team will give feedback or merge the PR.

## Do you intend to add a new substantial feature or change an existing one?🦸💻
<!-- 
Rough Notes here :
1. Need to get confirmation from OSLabs team to ensure that feature doesn't conflict with current work or future versions of the tool, but how to do this? 🤔
1. Open an Issue for this? Perhaps have a open issues/feature request/feature pitch template for this?
1. Once these are opened up someone from the OSLabs team needs to confirm/approve this is a good feature to work on
1. We can have another flag for issues currently being worked on

## Do you have questions about the source code?
- Ask any question about our products or their source code as a [discussions topic]() or join our the [Open Source Labs Slack Workspace]()
<!-- // TODO: Check on this too this can be done in discussions or on slack? should we really use slack?-->

## Do you want to contribute to our products' documentation? 📚
- Feel free to open an issue using the ["Documentation" template]() to start a discussion, or if you are feeling confident about the update make a PR and it will be reviewed by a core member of the team.
